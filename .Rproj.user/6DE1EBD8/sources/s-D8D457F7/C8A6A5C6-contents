## Purpose

The goal of this notebook is to work on integrating the 1940s census tracts data with the HOLC neighborhood gradings. Nardone et al. (2020) have already found that 1940s census tracts are not available for all cities with HOLC gradings; I'll explore to what extent HOLC cities with exposure to wells have 1940s census tracts data. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# first set up the environment; we need the `tidyverse` and `sf` packages
source("../../code/0-setup/01-setup.R")
```

```{r data_input, include=FALSE}
# HOLC and wells data
holc_cities_near_wells <-  # cities with exposure > 10 wells 
  read_csv("../../data/interim/holc_cities_buffer_1km_wells_all.csv") %>%
  filter(buffer_1km_wells_all_n >= 10)

# HOLC neighborhoods near wells
holc_cities_near_wells <-
  st_read("../../data/raw/univ_richmond/mapping_inequality/shapefile/holc_ad_data.shp") %>%
  st_transform(crs_projected) %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 0) %>%  # shortcut to address issue with dataset
  st_transform(crs_nad83) %>%
  mutate(city = as.factor(city)) %>%
  filter(city %in% holc_cities_near_wells$city) %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarize() 

# U.S. census tracts from 1940
tracts_1940 <- st_read("../../data/raw/ipums/nhgis0001_shapefile_tl2008_us_tract_1940/US_tract_1940_conflated.shp")
```

```{r data_prep, include=FALSE}
tracts_holc_cities <- holc_cities %>% st_intersection(tracts_1940)
```
