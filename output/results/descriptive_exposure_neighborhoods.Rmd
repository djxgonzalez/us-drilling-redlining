## Purpose

The goal of this notebook is to explore initial exposure data for HOLC neighborhoods across the U.S. We start with exposure data for (a) all wells and (b) producing wells within 1 km and 3 km of the centroid of each HOLC neighborhood. Producing wells were defined as wells with > 0 BOE of oil and/or gas production, as reported in the Enverus dataset.

This analysis is restricted to data from the 84 cities that were graded by HOLC and had at least 1 well within 1 km of the boundary of a HOLC-graded neighborhood.

## Cities

There were `r nrow(holc_cities)` cities in the HOLC dataset. Of these, `r nrow(holc_cities_buffer_1km_wells_all)` had wells within 1 km a HOLC-graded neighborhood. Of these, 49 had at least 10 wells.

#### Table. Number of wells within 1 km of graded neighborhoods

```{r echo=FALSe}
holc_cities_buffer_1km_wells_all %>%
